## The principle

### 1. What's IOC(Inversion of Control)

  IOC is aiming to solve highly interconnection or coupling between objects of our system, which realise decoupling naturally and decompose complex system into cooperative objects  
  As IOC appearing and being used, when Object A relied on B need call B, IOC will create an object B actively to inject into site where A need. Compared with previous behavior, it's not hart to find process of getting B turn an active action from a passive one contributing to source of IOC's name which is also called DI(dependency injection)  
  IOC can be regarded as a combination of object manufacturer and destruction plants
